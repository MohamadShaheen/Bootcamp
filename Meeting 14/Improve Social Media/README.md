# Basic Social Media Platform

This project is a fundamental social media platform
featuring user profiles. Each user is identified
by a unique username and has the ability to follow
other users and view their posts.

# Introduction

I developed this project to showcase a simplistic
and rudimentary social media platform, akin to 
popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and 
TikTok. 
As it employs a naive approach, the only requirement
is to install the `faker` library to generate 
random usernames.

# Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the faker library using pip:
`pip install faker`

# Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to create social media platform:
`python main.py`

# Flow Chart

The "Social Media" application comprises users, each possessing a unique username to distinguish them, along with a list of users they follow. Users are equipped with functionalities to follow new users and create posts.

The structure of the "Social Media" application involves a collection of user instances stored within a list. It offers functionalities for user registration and post generation for the users followed by the selected user.
